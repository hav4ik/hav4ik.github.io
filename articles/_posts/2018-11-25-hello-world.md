This post was made mainly to remind myself of how I made it and from where I copied the parts of the code (more on that in the next section), so that I can troubleshoot or upgrade the design or make modifications in the future.

# Where I stole the code

Do you really expected me, a Machine Learning engineer and a Mathematician, to know designing and `HTML` and `CSS` and `Javascript` and other stuffs related to web designing? *Of course not!* So I *stole* the snippets and design elements from other sites and blogs, and modified them so that they comes together into a nice and sleek design.

*  [Here][article-list] I stole the design of list of articles.
*  [Here][navbar] I stole the navigation bar (and added cool elements of my own)

Well, basically, I just copy-pasted my way to this blog.
