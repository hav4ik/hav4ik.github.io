Hi, my name is Chan Kha Vu. I'm a ML engineer at [Microsoft][msft] in Seattle Area, currently working on image ranking models at [Bing][bing-image-search]. Every time you search for images on [Bing][bing-image-search], the final results page are formed by the models trained with my code!

Previously, I worked at [Samsung Research][srk] on Monocular 3D Reconstruction, Multi-Task Learning, and optimizing Conv Nets for resource-constrained mobile devices. On a side for fun, I read (a lot of) Manga, [play Go][ogs] (feel free to send me a challenge), and a bit of [Kaggling][kaggle] (let's team up). I'm from Ukraine, by the way!
