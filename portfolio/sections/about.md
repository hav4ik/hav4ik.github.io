I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Samsung Research][srk] in Ukraine.
My main area of interest is Computer Vision, Network Optimization for Mobile Devices, GANs, and Reinforcement Learning.
The background in Mathematics allows me to delve deeper into the theory behind Deep Learning.

On a side for fun, I [travel][travelog] to new places, [tweet][twitter] about AI, [blog][blog] about stuffs I find exciting, paint, and [play Go][ogs] (feel free to drop me a match invitation).
