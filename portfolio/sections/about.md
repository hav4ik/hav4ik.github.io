I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Samsung Research][srk] in Ukraine.
My main area of interest is Computer Vision, Network Optimization for Mobile Devices, GANs, and Reinforcement Learning.
The background in Mathematics allows me to dig deeper into the theory behind Deep Learning. Here is my [CV][cv].

On a side for fun, I [travel][travelog] to new places, [blog][blog], paint, and [play Go][ogs] (feel free to drop me a match invitation).
