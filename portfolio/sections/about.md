I'm a software engineer at [Microsoft][msft] in Seattle Area, currently working on relevance ranking models at [Bing Image Search][bing-image-search]. My opinion is that high quality data and good pipeline engineering is as important as fancy State-of-the-Art models. I feel lucky to be part of such a dynamic team at Bing!

Previously, I was a computer vision engineer at [Samsung Research][srk] in Ukraine. I worked
on projects related to monocular 3D reconstruction and optimizing Neural Networks for resource-constrained Mobile Devices.

On a side for fun, I [travel][travelog] to new places, [blog][blog] about stuffs, paint, read (a lot of) Manga, [play Go][ogs] (feel free to send me a challenge), and a bit of [Kaggling][kaggle].
