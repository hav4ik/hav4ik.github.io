I'm a software engineer at [Microsoft][msft] in Seattle Area, currently working on relevance ranking models at Bing Image Search. It feels quite overwhelming to work with pipelines and data of such enormous scale.

Previously, I was a computer vision engineer at [Samsung Research][srk] in Ukraine. I worked
on projects related to monocular 3D reconstruction and optimizing Neural Networks for resource-constrained Mobile Devices.

On a side for fun, I [travel][travelog] to new places, [blog][blog] about stuffs, paint, read (a lot of) Manga, and [play Go][ogs] (feel free to challenge me), and a bit of [Kaggling][kaggle].
