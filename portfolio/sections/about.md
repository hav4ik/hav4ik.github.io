I'm currently a software engineer at [Microsoft][msft] in Redmond, United States. Working on customer-centric products of such scales is sooooo exciting!

Previously, I worked as a computer vision engineer at [Samsung Research][srk] in Ukraine,
specializing in Computer Vision and optimizing Neural Networks for resource-constrained Mobile Devices.

On a side for fun, I [travel][travelog] to new places, [blog][blog] about stuffs I find exciting, paint, read (a lot of) Manga, and [play Go][ogs] (feel free to challenge me). Oh, I also started to compete on [Kaggle][kaggle] lately out of boredom.
