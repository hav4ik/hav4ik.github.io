I'm currently a software engineer at [Microsoft][ms]. Previously, I worked as a computer vision engineer at [Samsung Research][srk] in Ukraine,
specializing in Computer Vision and Network Optimization for Mobile Devices. The background in Mathematics allows me to delve deeper into the theory behind Deep Learning.

On a side for fun, I [travel][travelog] to new places, [tweet][twitter] about AI, [blog][blog] about stuffs I find exciting, paint,
read (a lot of) Manga, and [play Go][ogs] (feel free to drop me a match invitation).
