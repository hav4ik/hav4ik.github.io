## Diagnosing Breast Cancer by analyzing the Interphase Nuclei of the Buccal Epithelium: a Hybrid Approach (2017)

This paper provides significant improvements to the non-invasive, radiation-free approach on diagnosing Breast Cancer by [Boroday et al.][boroday] that analyses the optical density of the Interphase Nuclei of Buccal Epithelium.
The proposed hybrid multi-level ensembling framework where learned features are naturally fused together with local hand-crafted features allowed us to distinguish Breast Cancer from Fibroadenomatis.
