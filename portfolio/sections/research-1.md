## Diagnosing Breast Cancer by analyzing the Interphase Nuclei of the Buccal Epithelium: a Hybrid Approach (BS thesis, 2017)

Under the supervision of [Prof. Klyushin Dmitrii][klyushin], we provided significant improvements to the non-invasive, radiation-free approach on diagnosing Breast Cancer by [Boroday et al.][boroday] that analyses the optical density of the Interphase Nuclei of Buccal Epithelium.
The proposed hybrid ensembling framework where CNN features are locally fused together with hand-crafted CV features allowed us to achieve better results with limited data.
