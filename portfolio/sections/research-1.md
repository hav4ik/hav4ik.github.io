## Diagnosing Breast Cancer by analyzing the Interphase Nuclei of the Buccal Epithelium: a Hybrid Approach (2017)

This project provides significant improvements to the non-invasive, radiation-free approach on diagnosing Breast Cancer by [Boroday et al.][boroday] that analyses the optical density of the Interphase Nuclei of Buccal Epithelium.
We propose a multi-level ensembling framework where learned features are naturally fused together with local hand-crafted features and train a Deep Neural Network in an end-to-end manner.
