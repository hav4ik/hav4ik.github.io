## Adaptive Multi-Head Network Branching using Feature Similarity (2019)

This work eliminates the limitations of previous Multi-Task Branching Scheme Search methods: it doesn't require each sample to have labels for all tasks, is not limited only to classification, and demands less resources. The core idea is to apply Network Slimming regularization after each block, then estimate affinity of branches as the sum of Jensen&ndash;Shannon Divergence between activations, weighted by pruning importance. This is part of my Master's thesis. **Work in progress.**
